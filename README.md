This is an idiomatic Zig implementation of Xor Filters ([arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08258)):

As well as Fuse Filters ([arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04749)):

> For large enough sets of keys, Dietzfelbinger & Walzer's fuse filters,
described in "Dense Peelable Random Uniform Hypergraphs", can accomodate fill factors up to 87.9% full, rather than 1 / 1.23 = 81.3%.

## Supported algorithms

This implementation supports a handful of filter algorithms:

- xor8
- xor16
- fuse8

Additionally, thanks to Zig's generics it is possible to use use any integral type for the xor filter's fingerprint bit sizes, e.g. xor2, xor4, xor32, xor64, etc. are all possible - as well as their map counterparts, something that [is hard to support in the C implementation](https://github.com/FastFilter/xor_singleheader/issues/8).

## Should I use xor filters or fuse filters?

Xor8 is the recommended default, and has no more than a 0.3% false-positive probability.

My _non-expert_ understanding is that fuse filters are more compressed and optimal than **xor+** filters with extremely large sets of keys based on[[1]](https://github.com/FastFilter/xor_singleheader/pull/11)[[2]](https://github.com/FastFilter/fastfilter_java/issues/21)[[3]](https://github.com/FastFilter/xorfilter/issues/5#issuecomment-569121442). You should use them in place of xor+, and refer to the xor filter paper for whether or not you are at a scale that requires xor+/fuse filters.

Note that the fuse filter algorithm does require a large number of unique keys in order for population to succeed, see [FastFilter/xor_singleheader#21](https://github.com/FastFilter/xor_singleheader/issues/21) - if you have few (<~125k consecutive) keys creation will fail.

This Zig implementation was written by [@slimsag](https://github.com/slimsag), drawing heavy inspiration from the original author's [C single-header](https://github.com/FastFilter/xor_singleheader) implementation. Please credit the above people if you use this library, as I would not have been able to write this implementation if not for their amazing work.
